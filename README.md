Tool for managing audio clips.

WASAPI can be bit perfect and even in shared mode it uses high quality resampler. Generally speaking though, when it comes to pure quality, it can't get any better than what exclusive WASAPI can offer. Not entirely sure how Direct Sound is handled in Windows 10 but it's either equal to WASAPI shared mode or worse.
